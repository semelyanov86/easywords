## FAQ

#### Do you have mobile app?

For learning words through smartphones you can use PWA. Just open in Google Chrome you domain through HTTPS and install your website as an app.

Also I have a mobile application for android. You can download and install APK using this link: [https://easywordsapp.ru/apps/flutter_apk/app.apk](https://easywordsapp.ru/apps/flutter_apk/app.apk)

For more information visit repository of mobile application: [https://github.com/semelyanov86/easywords-native](https://github.com/semelyanov86/easywords-native)

#### Can I connect multiple users to my app?

Yes, it is support multiuser functionality. But for now registration from frontend is not supported. You can create new users through admin page.

#### Can I add support for new language?

Yes, just add new language code in `config/app.php` file, `supported_languages` array.

For example:
````php
    'supported_languages' => [
        'DE', 'EN', 'ES'
    ],
````
Then you will need to create file in folder `database/seeders/samples/ES.php` 

This file should contain array with sample data of most popular words.

Then run command `php artisan db:seed --class=SampleSeeder`

Using this steps you can see new language - ES with sample data which you can import.
